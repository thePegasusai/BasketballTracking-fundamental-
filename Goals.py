Here is an example of code that can be used to create a pose estimation model for identifying a goal in soccer:

import torch
from torchvision.models.detection.faster_rcnn import FastRCNNPredictor
from torchvision.models.detection.mask_rcnn import MaskRCNNPredictor

# Load a pre-trained model for classification and return only the features
backbone = torchvision.models.mobilenet_v2(pretrained=True).features
# FasterRCNN needs to know the number of
# output channels in a backbone. For mobilenet_v2, it's 1280
# so we need to add it here
backbone.out_channels = 1280

# Let's make the RPN generate 5 x 3 anchors per spatial
# location, with 5 different sizes and 3 different aspect
# ratios. We have a Tuple[Tuple[int]] because each feature
# map could potentially have different sizes and
# aspect ratios
anchor_generator = torchvision.models.detection.rpn.anchor_generator.AnchorGenerator(
    sizes=(
